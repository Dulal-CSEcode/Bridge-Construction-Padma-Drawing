## Introduction

### Overview
The **Padma Bridge** project is one of Bangladesh’s most significant infrastructure developments. It involves constructing a 6.15 km long two-level steel truss bridge that connects the southwestern region to Dhaka. The bridge spans over the Padma River, accommodating four lanes of traffic on its upper level and a railway track on the lower level.

### Motivation
The construction of the Padma Bridge has profound social, economic, and logistical benefits for Bangladesh, connecting regions and improving accessibility. This project focuses on designing a portion of the bridge using **AutoCAD** software to create 3D models and facilitate better planning, visualization, and communication among stakeholders.

## Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The task is to design a portion of the Padma Bridge (minimum 150 meters) using **AutoCAD**. The design must meet the following requirements:
1. Ensure structural integrity against wind and seismic loads.
2. Handle heavy traffic and meet safety standards.
3. Complete the design within a given timeframe and budget.
4. Comply with environmental and legal standards.
5. Provide a 3D model of the bridge, detailing components such as piers, abutments, deck, and cables.

### Complex Engineering Problem
This project is a complex engineering challenge due to the integration of multiple factors: structural stability, hydraulic characteristics, and environmental impact. It requires collaboration, a deep understanding of bridge design, and proficiency with **AutoCAD**.
